# Bank_Product_Subscription_Prediction_Model

-Developed a customer subscriber prediction model for a financial institution using classification algorithms in WEKA
-Achieved a 94% accuracy rate in predicting customer subscription to new bank products using the J48 decision tree algorithm
-Performed data preprocessing and cleaning techniques on a dataset of 45,000 customer records, ensuring data quality for model training
-Evaluated and compared the performance of multiple classification models including K-NN, Naive Bayes, and logistic regression, selecting the most efficient model based on accuracy metrics
-Contributed to the development of a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve to visually represent model performance.
